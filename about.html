        <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
        My name is <em>Bryjon Trice</em>. I currently major in <strong>Experience Architecture</strong> and this is my third year of college. I enjoy playing piano, singing, watching anime, playing basketball, reading manga, and sometimes hanging out with friends. I would categorize myself as a extro-introvert because I love being alone but I sometimes like to go out with my friends and hang out. I also like cooking and learning new recipes for myself.
